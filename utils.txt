Hooks:
Rules:
	-Only call React Hooks in React Functions(React Component Functions or Custom Hooks)
	-Only call React Hooks at the top Level, no in nested functions or in any block statements
	--Add everything yo refer to inside useEffect as a dependency, unless good reason for no to do so

-useSate: Allows you to add state to a functional component, returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it
-useEffect: Allows you to perform side effects in your components, ex of side effects are: fetching data, timers. Take 2 arguments. runs after component evaluation
			if the dependencies has change
-useReducer: Similar to useState. Good for complex logic. Takes 3 arg useReducer(<reducer>, <initialState>, <initFn>)
-useContext: Allows to the component to listen to the React context.
